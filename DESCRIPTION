Description: Methods and tools for the analysis of Genome Wide 
    Identity-by-Descent (gwid) mapping data, focusing on testing whether there 
    is a higher occurrence of IBD segments around potential causal variants 
    in cases compared to controls, which is crucial for identifying rare 
    variants. To enhance its analytical power, gwid incorporates a Sliding 
    Window Approach, allowing for the detection and analysis of signals from 
    multiple SNPs.
