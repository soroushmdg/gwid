GWID (Genome Wide Identity by Descent) is an R-package designed for the analysis of IBD (Identity by Descent) data, to discover rare alleles associated with case-control phenotypes. Although Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) successfully reveal numerous common variants linked to diseases, they exhibit lack of power to identify rare alleles. To address this limitation, we have developed a pipeline that employs IBD data (output of refined-IBD software). This methodology encompasses a sequential process for analyzing the aforementioned data within isolated populations. The primary objective of this approach is to enhance the sensitivity of variant detection by utilizing information from genetically related individuals, thereby facilitating the identification of causal variants. An overall representation of the procedural workflow is visually depicted in the accompanying figure.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gwid from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("soroushmdg/gwid")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gwid)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
